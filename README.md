## About
In this project, we were tasked with designing an ERD on a series of tables containing employee information, building and importing those tables and their relations in Postgresql, and building views based off of those tables.

## Getting Started
Code is located within the code folder and is made to run in postgres. When running your code, run the "create-tables-schema" first, then import the csv files, then run "data-analysis-schema".
